Ansible role that installs provided list of base packages for which does not make sense to create separate roles.

Packages are installed according to user specification - from native operating system package manager or `pip` (package installer for Python).

**When pip packages are requested to be installed - the role will install native operating system package to provide `pip` command and additional dependencies in case executed on hosts where Ansible is leveraging on Python 2.x (ie. role will install `epel-release` on EL7).**

Requirements

Role Variables

Lists of packages to be installed (using native package manager and `pip`):
```yaml
base_packages:
  - package_name1
  - package_name2
  ...

base_pip_packages:
  - pip_package_name1
  - pip_package_name2
  ...
```
By default both lists of packages are empty.

Variable `pip_package` specifies name of native operating system package delivering `pip`, which is installed whenever `base_pip_packages` is not empty. It's set by default to:
- `python3-pip` for distributions where Ansible leverages on Python 3.x
- `python-pip` for other distributions


Dependencies
